  "info": "R Doradus is the name of a red giant Mira variable star in the far-southern constellation Dorado, although visually it appears more closely associated with the constellation Reticulum. Its distance from Earth is 178 ± 10 light-years (54.6 ± 3.1 parsecs). Having a uniform disk diameter of 0.057 ± 0.005 arcsec it is currently believed to be the star with the second largest apparent size as viewed from Earth (right after the Sun). The estimated diameter of R Doradus is 515 ± 70 million km (3.46 AU) or 370 ± 50 times the diameter of the Sun. If placed at the centre of the Solar System, the orbit of Mars and most of the main asteroid belt would be contained within the star.",
